# Game Developers' Association Website

Our team, 5 Bit Bunch, were tasked to create a website for the Game Developers' Association. Our main tool for development was the MERN stack. The website allows users to upload and showcase their games on the GDA Website.

## Motivation

The development of this GDA Website was a learning experience. Throughout this project, we introduced ourselves to CircleCI testing, different frameworks, and methods of teamwork. Our goal was to provide GDA with an easy to use website that would satisfy their main requirements.

## Installation
Install and use the open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) to run the GDA Website through terminal.

In terminal, set the directory to the server folder within the main GDA_WEBSITE folder. Run these codes to start the backend server and connect the website to MongoDB.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

In terminal, set the directory to the "loginv2.1 2" folder within the main GDA_WEBSITE folder. Run these codes to start the backend server for the user database and connect it to MongoDB.

```bash
npm install
npm install bcrypt
npm start
```

In terminal, set the directory to the main GDA_WEBSITE folder. Run these codes to start the website

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
